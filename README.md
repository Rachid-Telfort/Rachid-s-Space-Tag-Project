This game was my submission for Mini Jam 24 - Space. 
The link to the jam is https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-24-space.

In the game, you and the enemy orbs have agreed to a game of space tag to instead of battling it out. The condition is you are always the one that gets tagged! Thus, in the game you have to avoid the enemy orbs as long as possible. If you are tagged, that's it, game over. In addition, more orbs will join in the tag over time making things more difficult for you. The main goal of this game is to have fun and test your mouse reflexes. 

In the start menu you mouse click on the corresponding text to start the game or quit the game.

In the game level, to move the ship you move the mouse in the desired direction and the ship will follow it. Be aware as the enemy orbs will try to follow your direction! Outsmart them to avoid them as long as possible. To pause or unpause the game, right click with the mouse and the pause menu will appear or disappear.

When the game is paused, mouse click on the text to perform the desired action.

When the game is over, the game will enter a modified paused state where you cannot resume the game, the other paused options will be available however. When this modified pause menu shows up, click on the text to perform the desired action.

Finally, I hope that my fellow coders find this code and project to be useful. 
Thank you for checking out my GitHub page, it is much appreciated!
